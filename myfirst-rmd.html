# Introduction
---
### Validity of self-assessment
* As an abstract concept, education attempts to measure a variety of latent variables, including academic ability, creativity, and career maturity.&lt;br/&gt;

* In particular, in the classroom, the latent variable of most interest to teachers and students is academic ability.&lt;br/&gt;

* There are many ways to measure academic ability.

* In particular, there are several studies on self-assessment validity.

---
### Validity conditions from a structural perspective
* In order for the measurement of a latent variable to be causally valid, **Exclusion Restriction assumption** must be met.

* In measurement, Exclusion Restriction assumption means that the exogenous variable affects the indicators by fully mediating the latent variable.

* Assessment that do not fulfill the Exclusion Restriction assumption can lead to serious social problems such as fairness.

# Theoretical background

---
### Structural Causal Model of Exclusion Restriction Assumption
.pull-left[
* Structural causal model for the Exclusion Restriction assumption in the measurement model is shown in Figure 1.

* In Figure 1, the red path indicates a violation of the Exclusion Restriction Assumption.

* Among the non-causal path, because of the path of the red line, `\(X_1\)` contains information from `\(T\)`.
  * `\(\eta \rightarrow X_1\)`: Causal path
  * `\(\eta \leftarrow T  \rightarrow X_1\)`: Non-causal path

### Structural description of the DIF &lt;br/&gt; (utilizing gender and self-assessment)
* The Exclusion Restriction Assumption in measurement is structurally very similar to Differential Item Functioning (DIF).

* Gender affects self-evaluation in two ways.

  * The first path is the **rational path** (the path through which the population variable affects the correctness rate via ability).

  * The second path is the **irrational path** (where the population variable directly affects the correctness rate).

* Here, the second path is **violating the Exclusion Restriction Assumption**.

* This means that groups of people with the same ability may have different rates of correct responses.
---
### Assumption of univariate latent variable
* Causally related components are typically multivariate, not univariate, and it is necessary to validate this univariate assumption.

* For example, it is not that the psychological construct of motivation affects specific behaviors (outcomes), but rather that each empirical item that measures motivation can affect specific behaviors (outcomes).

* Univariate assumptions in latent factor models are empirically testable.

# Research Methods
---
### Drawing Causal relationship about ability

* The purpose of this study is to test the causal validity of self-assessment,

* For the purpose of validation, ability test was utilized as the gold standard.

* The structural causal model between the variables of interest is shown in figure 2.

Figure 2
&lt;/center&gt;
---
### Testing the Exclusion Restriction Assumption in a measurement
#### Testing Assumption of univariate latent variable
* The general latent factor model has the equation (1).
`$$X_i = \lambda_i\eta_i + \epsilon_i$$`
&lt;center&gt; equation (1) &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

* If the exclusion constraint assumption is satisfied in Eq. (1), Theorem 1 is derived.
`$$E(X_i \mid Z=z) - E(X_i \mid Z=z*) = \alpha_i\beta_i$$`
&lt;center&gt; Theorem 1 &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* If Theorem 1 does not hold, the exclusion constraint assumption is **rejected**.
---
### Testing the Exclusion Restriction Assumption in a measurement
#### Gain score Method
* Gain score method requires that the common trend assumption ( `\(\beta_1\)` = `\(\beta_2\)` ) is satisfied.

* The various measures can be expected to be similarly affected by ability.

* **If `\(\tau\)` is statistically significant**, it means that exogenous variables other than academic ability **directly affect self-assessment**.

# Research findings

---
### Degree of discrepancy
* The degree of discrepancy was calculated as the difference between self-assessment and ability test.

* It was divided into three categories:
  * Underestimation is when the difference between self-assessment and ability test is **negative**,
  * Agreement is when the difference is **zero**,
  * Overestimation is when the difference is **positive**.

### Testing Assumption of univariate latent variable
* Exogenous Variable was redefined as a variable with four response categories.

* Specifically, the response categories were recoded as
  * 1 (male, parental income below average)
  * 2 (male, parental income above average)
  * 3 (female, parental income below average)
  * 4 (female, parental income above average)
  
* The null hypothesis is as follows. &lt;br/&gt;
`$$H_0: \{E(P \mid Z=2) - E(P \mid Z=1)\} \times \{E(Y \mid Z=4) - E(Y \mid Z=1)\}$$` 
 `$$= \{E(P \mid Z=4) - E(P \mid Z=1)\} \times \{E(Y \mid Z=2) - E(Y \mid Z=1)\}$$`
 
* Here's what the alphabet means
  * `\(P\)`: Ability Test
  * `\(Y\)`: Self-assessment
  * `\(Z\)`: Exogenous variables

<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-b6b20ae6f0e27cad2afa">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"fillContainer":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6"],["Korean","Korean","Korean","Math","Math","Math"],[2018,2019,2020,2018,2019,2020],[-0.13,-0.06,-0.15,-0.08,-0.09,-0.12],[-0.03,0.02,-0.01,-0.02,-0.02,-0.01]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>subject<\/th>\n      <th>year<\/th>\n      <th>X2.5<\/th>\n      <th>X97.5<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":3,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[2,3,4]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[3,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

* Except for Korean (2019), 95% confidence intervals with bootstrap did not include zero.

* This means that we **reject** the null hypothesis.

* The test results do not indicate the exact model.

* Considering that parental income and gender are unlikely to have a direct effect on the ability test, 

* This means that **gender can have a direct impact on self-evaluation**.

---
### Gain Score Analysis
#### Gender
* Gender is a prime example of an exogenous variable.

* Exogenous variables are likely to affect academic performance through a variety of pathways.

* Gender is a factor in self-assessment and self-report measures, as well as social desirability bias.

* For analysis purposes, boys were recoded as 0 and girls as 1.

* If `\(\tau\)` is statistically significant, we can say that gender has a direct effect on self-evaluation, not mediated by academic ability.
---
#### Analysis results
* Results are for Korean and Math courses from 2018-2021.

* Circles are point estimates, vertical lines are 95% confidence intervals.

* If the vertical line does not meet the dotted line on the horizontal line, it is statistically significant.

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; Figure 4 &lt;/center&gt;
---
#### Analysis results
* The sign of the point estimates was consistently negative.

* This means that girls rate themselves lower than boys in Self-evaluation.

* This means that there may be gender differences in self-evaluation results other than academic ability.

# Conclusion
---
### Summary
* Students tend to overestimate their academic abilities compared to ability tests.

* Self-Assessment is a method that is directly affected by factors other than academic ability.

* Using self-assessments as a measure of academic performance can be dangerous.


### Limitation and Suggestions
* Establishing the ability test as the gold standard for academic ability without further empirical validation.

* Further research is needed on the effects of discrepancy between self-assessment and academic ability.

* One can utilize the univariate latent variable assumption test to test for DIF.
